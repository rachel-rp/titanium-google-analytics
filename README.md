# Google Analytics Module

Connects to Google Analytics for app event tracking in a Titanium Appcelerator Application. The 2.x release of this module is targeted for the [Google Analytics SDK for iOS v3](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ios/v3/) and [Google Analytics SDK v4 for Android](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/android/v4/).

## 64bit Capability

Version 3.0.0 of this module depends on version 3.5.0.GA (or greater) of the titanium SDK, which provides 64bit support on the iOS platform. If you are upgrading your application to use this new version and you are experiencing build problems, try clearing out your `build` and `Resources` folders and then recompile.

## Set up Google Analytics

First step: you have to create a new app property in your Google Analytics-account. Refer to [this page](http://support.google.com/analytics/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2587086&topic=2587085&ctx=topic) for more information.

## Google Play Services

If you find that you are experiencing errors related to Google Play Services, then you should do two things:

1. Ensure the device you are using has Google Play installed.

2. Ensure your local sdk has the Google Play libraries installed. It is best if the library is at least version 21.

If you have checked both and you are still experiencing errors, then you can try uninstalling your local Google Play library and re-installing it.

## Usage

To access this module from JavaScript, you need to do the following:

```javascript
var GA = require("analytics.google");
```

The GA variable is a reference to the Module object. To interact with the tracker, create a tracker instance using the `getTracker` method.

```javascript
var tracker = GA.getTracker("UA-1234567-8");
tracker.trackEvent({
	category: "Loading",
	action: "cancelled"
});
```

It has been suggested to store the tracker object on `Alloy.Globals` for convenience. For example:

```javascript
// In Alloy.js
var GA = require("analytics.google");
Alloy.Globals.tracker = GA.getTracker(Alloy.CFG.googleAnalyticsId);

// Now in any controller, you can use the API as outlined in the documentation.
Alloy.Globals.tracker.trackEvent({
  category: "Loading",
  action: "cancelled"
});
```

## Reference

### Module.trackUncaughtExceptions

Set this property on the module to true when you want to enable uncaught exception tracking (crashes). Note this will not catch crashes on the Javascript thread (i.e. the Titanium "Red Screen of Death"), but should catch the exceptions on the native threads. In Android, we must initialize a tracker prior to setting this. If more than a single Tracker is used in the app, the last one set is the one that will track the uncaught exceptions.

```javascript
var GA = require("analytics.google");
var tracker = GA.getTracker("UA-XXXXXXX-X"); // Android: Must be called prior to setting trackUncaughtExceptions
GA.trackUncaughtExceptions = true;
```

### Module.optOut

Set this property to true if you want to disable analytics across the entire app.

```javascript
var GA = require("analytics.google");
GA.optOut = false;
```

### Module.dryRun

Set this property to true if you want to enable debug mode. This will prevent sending data to Google Analytics.

```javascript
var GA = require("analytics.google");
GA.dryRun = true;
```

### Module.dispatchInterval

Data collected using the Google Analytics SDK for Android is stored locally before being dispatched on a separate thread to Google Analytics. By default, data is dispatched from the Google Analytics SDK for Android every 30 minutes. By default, data is dispatched from the Google Analytics SDK for iOS every 2 minutes. Set this property if you would like to change the interval in seconds. Note that the iOS SDK requires the value in seconds and the Android SDK requires the value in minutes at the moment.

```javascript
var GA = require("analytics.google");
if(Ti.Platform.osname == 'android') {
    GA.dispatchInterval = 2; // in minutes
}
else if(Ti.Platform.name == 'iPhone OS') {
    GA.dispatchInterval = 120; // in seconds
}
```
